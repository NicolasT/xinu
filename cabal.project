-- Note: when making changes, they likely need to be applied to the
-- other local packages as well (for some reason, unlike as documented,
-- having them at the top-level doesn't work as expected).
-- Furthermore, when making changes, the `Local-Ghc-Options` value in
-- `cabal.haskell-ci` must be updated as well.
